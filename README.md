## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jomardiago/brighte-eats-ui.git
cd brighte-eats-api
```

### 2. Install dependencies (Due to using the latest version of Next.js, we need to make sure we install legacy dependencies)

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 3. Run the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

App will be available at: http://localhost:3000

### 4. .env file

Make sure to rename the .example.env file to .env. Here you will see the url for the backend api. Please make sure that it is pointing to your correct local backend instance.
